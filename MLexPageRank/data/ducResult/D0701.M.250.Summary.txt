MOBILE, Ala
 (AP) -- A white supremacist arrested after buying   hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail  bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said

Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the   Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a  federal agent testified at a federal court hearing

``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special   agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said  Friday

There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might   have been targeted in the national and state capital cities
 An ATF  representative did not immediately return calls for comment  Saturday

Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm   found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was  apparently a silencer

Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam   legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record

A federal magistrate ordered him held pending the results of a   psychological evaluation

If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison,   said Assistant U
 Attorney Greg Bordenkircher
 No charges were  immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase

Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday,   arriving with a loaded, cocked 
45-caliber pistol on his hip and  his 20-month-old son in his arms

``I knew he wasn't quite right,'' Pasqualotto said

The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam   contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto  testified

He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the   FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver  during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with  civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern  Poverty Law Center
