CLARKSTON, Mich
 (AP) -- Veteran musician John Mellencamp was on   hand for a ceremony designed to help rookies start playing

Before a Wednesday night concert, Mellencamp and officials with   the Save the Music Foundation announced the donation of $75,000  worth of musical instruments to three Detroit schools

The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music   programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about  the importance of music education

``I'm very excited about it,'' said Charles Moody, the principal   of Bethune Elementary School in Pontiac, one of the three schools
  ``We know the impact that music has on a child's development
PORTLAND, Ore
 (AP) -- Oregon, with the nation's fastest-growing   economy and highest SAT scores, is hardly a place where you would  expect a school funding crisis

Yet many schools have overflowing classes, outdated textbooks,   insufficient supplies and cuts in arts and sports
 The Lebanon  School District has boarded up one school because there's no money  for repairs, and classes are held in trailers, said Superintendent  Jim Robinson

``Anybody who doubts that there is a problem should go spend a   day in a classroom,'' said Gov
 John Kitzhaber, who has been  pushing for a major boost in school funding
 ``You've got kids  trying to learn algebra in classes of 40 students
 This isn't the  kind of system we want our kids to learn in
''
The problem evolved over the past decade as voters slashed   property taxes at the same time academic standards were being  toughened

Lincoln High School, on the edge of Portland's downtown, has cut   all music programs
 Cellos and basses gather dust in a corner of a  music room that is now a humanities classroom, with two teachers  for 86 students

``There are so many students that the teachers discourage people   from writing papers,'' said graduating senior Paul Susi
 ``They  don't have time to read 86 papers
''
``Economically this country is at the peak of its game,'' Susi   said
 ``How is it that when we are the most prosperous and  successful that we can't find out how to adequately fund our own  schools
''
Property tax limits passed by voters during the 1990s largely   left the state in charge of funding schools
 The state now pays  about 80 percent of local schools' costs, compared with 30 percent  before the tax limits

Per-student spending has increased, but hasn't kept up with   inflation

``Eighty-five percent of the cost of schools is pay, perks and   pensions,'' he said
