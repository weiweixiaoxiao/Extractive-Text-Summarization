BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two recent Eurobarometer opinion polls showed that a majority of European Union(EU) citizens are in favor of the single currency

Seven out of ten find the name of the Single currency "Euro" acceptable, almost one in four say the opposite, and one in twelve have no opinion

About the future European currency, 20 percent feel "well informed", 79 percent feel to be not well informed

In countries such as Sweden, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, more than 80 percent people feel to be "not very well informed" or "not at all informed"
BRUSSELS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) spokesman today formally denied newspaper reports that the EC is "secretly" drawing up plans to delay the launch of the single currency, the Euro

"The commission firmly sticks to its position that the Euro shall be introduced in conformity with the (Maastricht) Treaty criteria and timetable which have been confirmed by the December European Council of Madrid," the spokesman said

At the Madrid summit last December, leaders of EU member nations agreed unanimously that the European single currency will be formally launched on January 1, 1999
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Declaring that "Currency is politics," French Prime Minister Alain Juppe today reiterated France's determination to realize the single European currency

"The economic and monetary union is neither a technical issue, nor an economic demand," Juppe noted at a debate on the European economic and monetary union in the National Assembly
 "It is firstly and mainly a political plan for us
"
He pointed out that such a political plan concerns the future of France and Germany, as well as the future role which the European countries will play in the world

Stressing that the introduction of a single currency will be a great contribution to the unity of an expanded European Union (EU), Juppe reiterated France's commitment to the timetable and criteria of the single currency system set in the Maastricht treaty, under which the single European currency, recently named Euro, will be realized by January 1, 1999

Many people worry that the tough budgetary criteria for the single currency will cause rising unemployment and worsening social welfare
