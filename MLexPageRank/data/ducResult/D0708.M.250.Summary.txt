LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The supply of water in the Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight days, the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here today

Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage problem in Luanda
 He said that the government was short of money to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital

DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply with no sign of immediate improvement

Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand of 1
29 billion liters in Dhaka

Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for WASA to meet the demand

They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage

The onset of the summer heat has further drained the ground water in Dhaka while adding to the sufferings of some 6 million thirsty residents in the old city

The officials held no optimism about an easy solution to the problem before a new water treatment plant starts operation
