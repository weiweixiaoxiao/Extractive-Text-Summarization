BEVERLY HILLS, Calif
 (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare In   Love'' and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture  acting, and Michael J
 Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV  comedy actor at the Golden Globes

Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and   Monsters'' won motion picture supporting actor honors

The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which   the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a  touching note

The ``Spin City'' star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's   disease, thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up  his brain
 ``We're so lucky to do what we do 
 and just take  every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said

Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and   muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also  won best screenplay
 In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy  agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for  show tunes into a star

``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor
 ``My   career must be slipping
 This is the first time I've been available  to pick up an award
''
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading   movie nominees, with six apiece
 ``Saving Private Ryan'' followed  with five
 ``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and  ``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece

The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued   by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing  momentarily

Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show   by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man,  I just got through eating dinner
''
Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the   summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their  award-worthy product
 ``I'm glad that people didn't forget about  it,'' he said

Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging   horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32  years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been  crying out for a friend ever since
''
In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The   Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor  and actress, respectively in television dramatic series

Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series   for ``Dharma and Greg

Stanley Tucci of ``Winchell'' won best actor in a miniseries or   TV movie
