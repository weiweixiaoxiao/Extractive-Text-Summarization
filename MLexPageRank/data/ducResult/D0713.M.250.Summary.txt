ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "Pakistan has nuclear capability, but has decided at the highest level not to use it for non-peaceful purposes," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here today

Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this afternoon, he strongly refuted the report that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear test

The Washington Post daily quoted some US officials as saying Wednesday that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province

"The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its security," said the spokesman

The statement described the Washington Post's story as "speculative and based on faulty leaked intelligence reports
"
"Pakistan has been in the vanguard locally and regionally to advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation," said the spokesman

"Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have fumbled because of India's negativism," he added

The US government has also criticized India recently for preparing for its second nuclear test
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday described China's stance on the nuclear issue as "mature and highly responsible
"
He said it was "in sharp contrast to the irresponsible stance of India
"
"As you know, China is the only nuclear weapon state which has repeatedly and authoritatively stated that it will never under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons," Shamshad told reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport after concluding a two-day visit to Beijing

"This mature and highly responsible approach to issues of international peace and security by China stands in sharp contrast to the irresponsible statements emanating from the Indian leadership, threatening the use of nuclear weapons," he said

He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation

"We are not seeking any bargains," Sharif said in a written statement issued at a press conference here
