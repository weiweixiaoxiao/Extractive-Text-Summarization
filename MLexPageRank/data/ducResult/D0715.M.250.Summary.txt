GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban land mines that   kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force  today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace

The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133   countries and ratified by 65 of them
 About 12 countries have  destroyed their entire stocks of land mines

Major users and producers -- including the United States, Russia   and China -- have refused to join in
 And even with the treaty, it  will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines  scattered in more than 60 countries

``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not   just in law but also in implementation,'' U
 Secretary-General  Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony in Geneva

``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the   fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle  but in practice,'' he said

Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six   others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern  Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today

The treaty, agreed to after a campaign by charities working with   victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, stocks and  exports of land mines

President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the   accord -- saying the United States needs to use mines until then  along the tense border between North and South Korea

Seats for the U
 delegation were conspicuously empty at the   start of a ceremony marking the land mines accord at U
  headquarters in Geneva

The sounds of a ``peace bell'' and a children's choir floated   through U
 offices in Vienna, Austria, to mark the accord coming  into force

Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban   Land Mines -- which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize -- said her group  would this year focus its campaign on the Middle East and former  Soviet Union to try to persuade them to go along with the accord

The cause also was supported by Princess Diana
 Diana drew   attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk through a  minefield in Angola in February 1997
 She died in a car crash in  Paris on Aug
 31 of that year
GENEVA (AP) -- A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has made a significant difference in its first 18 months, but major blackspots -- among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain, anti-mine campaigners said Thursday
 Sudan has denied the allegation
 Guerrillas also planted mines
