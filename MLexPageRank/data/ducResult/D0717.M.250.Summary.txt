CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- A company hid evidence that half of the   popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart  problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp
  for $110 million said Wednesday

The lawsuit is believed to be the first to reach a courtroom   over the issue of heart valve damage caused by fen-phen or Redux,  and experts said a victory for the woman could prove key to other  cases

A 12-member jury was seated to hear the case, filed by Sandra   Moore against American Home Products Corp
, the parent of  pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories

``The sales and marketing people said if you put a black box   warning on this product you are going to see sales of the product  cut in half,'' Michael McGartland said during opening statements of  the civil trial

``They were making a lot of money,'' he said
 ``It doesn't take   a rocket scientist to figure out what the motivation was
''
Ms
 Moore, a former Alvarado resident who now lives in Missoula,   Mont
, claims she wasn't warned about the risks of taking  fenfluramine, marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin, or  dexfenfluramine, a similar drug sold by the company as Redux

Fenflurmaine and Redux have been taken off the market
   Fenfluramine makes up half of the ``fen-phen'' combination  prescribed to thousands of patients to promote weight loss
 The  other half, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when  taken alone and is still on the market

Defense lawyer Bill Sims said he looks forward to putting the   facts before the jury

``There's a lot of misinformation circulating about these drugs   and why they were voluntarily withdrawn from the market,'' he said
  ``We are going to tell it like it is
''
Doctors found mild heart valve damage after Ms
 Moore, 52, took   fen-phen for 10 months in 1996
 She is now on medication for her  condition
CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) -- Attorneys for American Home Products   Corp
 insist the company is not liable for the health problems of a  woman who used the diet-drug combination fen-phen, saying she  misused the products and was predisposed to heart disease

Sandra Moore has sued the company for $110 million in the   nation's first trial involving the once-popular weight-loss drugs

Testimony was expected to begin today
 Moore claims she had to quit her job because of heart valve   damage caused by fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen combination,  and Redux, a similar product
