PORTLAND, Ore
 (AP) -- Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired   to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks

Seattle-based Starbucks hopes that with Tazo it can attract new   customers
 The company will discontinue its in-house Infusia brand  of tea, which currently accounts for just 1 percent of Starbucks'  $1
3 billion in annual sales

``Tea will drive more people into our stores, and I think this   is the highest-quality tea in the nation,'' said Howard Schultz,  Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer
 ``It's a much-loved  brand
''
Tazo should be available in Starbucks stores by the end of the   year

Tazo calls itself ``The Reincarnation of Tea'' on its labels and   cultivates a quirky image
 The ingredients listing, for example,  says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified  tea shaman
''
Tazo is sold in tea bags, in leaves and bottled as iced tea
 Its   blends include minty Refresh, chamomile-based Calm, citrus Wild  Sweet Orange, and Passion, billed as a blend of hibiscus and other  tropical flowers and herbs

Steve Smith, who founded Tazo in 1994, would not disclose what   Starbucks paid for Tazo

SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp
 warned Wednesday that annual   profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its  non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet  portal

Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60   cents per share for fiscal 1999
 But Starbucks late Wednesday  predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the  next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations
