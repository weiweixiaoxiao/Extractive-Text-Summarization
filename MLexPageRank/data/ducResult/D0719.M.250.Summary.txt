LYON, France, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred people took part in the demonstration here today against the policies of the world's most developed nations

The protest took place when leaders of the group of seven (G-7) industrialized nations gathered in this southeastern French city for a three-day summit meeting

The peaceful demonstration, organized by a group of 53 non-governmental organizations, consisted of a series of speeches at Lyon's city labor exchange

"The G-7 presents itself as the pilot of the general ship of world affairs, thus it places itself in a situation of power and responsibility," said Nigerian Nobel Literature Prize laureate Wole Soyinka, who chaired the event

"However," Soyinka noted, the group's collective course "militates against the well-being of the majority of peoples
"
This, he added, is "leading to mass unemployment, a widening gap between the North and the South and even more profoundly between the affluent and the poor in every society
"
"We appeal to the members of the G-7 to take stock of their power and its failures, to be aware of the consequences of the policies that they set in motion," he said

The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the G-7 summit, which drew here leaders from France, the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan
