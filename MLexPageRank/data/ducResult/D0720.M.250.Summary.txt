For the first time in Israel's history, its upcoming election is about who will control the Interior Ministry, not the Foreign Ministry
 It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel

Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
 By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process
 It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist
 It is no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian state while Likud rejects it

Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75 percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a Palestinian state of some size or other
 With that sort of consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign Ministry

Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two sides
 He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters that he was not abandoning their cause
 It may have been that the only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying, blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and ``the leftists,'' and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up to his commitments or not
 Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo _ and he accommodated them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who delivered it

Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process _ but he stayed out of it himself
 That is, he never wanted to take ownership of it, and he still doesn't
 Bibi struck important deals that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs against him in this election
 In 1996, Bibi won because a majority of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and the blowing up of Israeli buses

But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept Oslo
 He repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up in Jerusalem
