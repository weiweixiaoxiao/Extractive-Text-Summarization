LARAMIE, Wyo
 (AP) -- A prosecutor asked 71 prospective jurors   today to set aside the emotions of pity and rage if chosen for the  trial in the death of gay college student Matthew Shepard

Prosecutor Cal Rerucha also told the panel to remember that   Shepard, who was beaten and left tied to a fence in near-freezing  weather last fall, was ``a victim that was different, a victim that  was not the same as you and I
''
But he emphasized that the Constitution requires all people to   be treated fairly under the law

Rerucha's statements came as the trial of Russell Henderson   began in Albany County District Court

During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt   Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's  co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later

``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew   Shepard,'' Skaggs said

He also warned jurors they would be seeing ``really, really   graphic'' photos during the trial
 As he said this, Matthew  Shepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom,  slowly looked down

By the lunch break, 10 prospective jurors had been dismissed for   various reasons, including health and business issues
 One woman  was dismissed for child care reasons

During the morning session, Henderson, 21, showed little emotion   and occasionally looked at the pool of possible jurors seated in  the courtroom's spectator section

Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death   penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for  gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime  legislation

Opening statements were scheduled for April 6

Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school   dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound  Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him,  leaving him lashed to a fence
 Shepard, a political science major  at the University of Wyoming, was not found for hours and died five  days later at a hospital

Despite the attention given the case, there were only a few   spectators in the courtroom
 Fenced-off areas for protesters  outside were empty
 Still, police stepped up patrols today outside  the courthouse because anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates  have clashed repeatedly over the case

Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained   his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work
   ``Matt was a person
 He wasn't just a gay man
