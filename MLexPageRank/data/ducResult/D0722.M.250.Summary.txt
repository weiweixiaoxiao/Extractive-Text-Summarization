WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy   a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on  land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of  conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday

``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr
, chairman of   the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon  anti-missile programs during the Bush administration

Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from   countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency''  on the matter

The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14   retired officers and defense and political officials who served  mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White  House of failing to make missile defense a national priority

President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in   spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve  $6
6 billion over the next five years for program development

A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the   Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10
5 billion to  build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005

The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to   defend U
 cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less  than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy

The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's   22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as  well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay  tracking data

A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19   billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile  defense systems to protect the 50 U
 states as well as American  troops overseas

Navy Capt
 Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the   Defense Department had no comment on the Heritage Foundation  findings

The Navy already has spent $1 billion developing a so-called   theater missile defense system to protect ships and troops from  regional threats, mostly from short- and medium-range missiles
 But  it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a  missile out of the sky

In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy,   the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can  defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise  missiles
 territory against  limited ballistic missile attack
