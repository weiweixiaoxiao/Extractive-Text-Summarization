WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obese women are six times more likely than   thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their  arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing  heart disease, researchers said Tuesday

If the findings are verified, they suggest scientists should   study whether the aspirin some heart patients take might also help  overweight people reduce their chances of heart attacks

Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease:   The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high  cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and  other cardiovascular risk factors

But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another   risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries

In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently   discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years  and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or  stroke

No one knows what causes the subtle inflammation
 One theory has   been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests  that antibiotics may help fight heart disease
 On the other hand,  doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at  high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood -- and  aspirin also reduces inflammation

Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves   can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes  inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream

So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a   U
 database of 16,000 Americans

The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a   blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP
 CRP levels  skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases  like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease
 But lower levels,  between 0
2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the  ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists  concerned

Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to   have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people

Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference   Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were  much more overweight than men studied

``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday,   before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here
 If  verified, ``it could have quite an impact
