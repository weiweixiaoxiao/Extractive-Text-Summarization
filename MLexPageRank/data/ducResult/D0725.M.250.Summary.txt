WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction

``We will continue to work hard to block those efforts,'' White House national security spokesman David Leavy said
 officials were not pleased with reports Friday from Moscow that Iran may order from Russia an additional three nuclear reactors for power generation

Although Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Russia insists its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm

The New York Times reported Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon
 CIA Director George Tenet has been briefing other U
 policy-makers on the new assessment, the newspaper said

National Security officials would not comment directly on the report but agreed that the possibility that Iran may be able to manufacture nuclear weapons has been a growing worry

``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' Leavy said

Intelligence and defense experts warned that Iran may be closer than previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal

A senior intelligence official said the United States is watching closely the worrisome problem of availability of fissionable material to Iran, which could use it to make nuclear bombs

There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials to weapons

A reason for differing estimates, officials said, is the difficulty in monitoring Iran's acquisition of nuclear materials and technology

As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach targets in the United States by 2010
 Officials now suggest the timetable might have to be shortened in light of the recent developments
 efforts to persuade Russia to stop providing nuclear technology to Iran have met with little success

Russian engineers already are building a reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing contract
 enemies as a major rationale for moving to develop a national missile defense
