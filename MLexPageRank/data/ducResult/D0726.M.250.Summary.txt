WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore appealed to black   members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn  out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and  return control of the House to Democrats

He noted that a turnover of the House from Republican to   Democratic control in the 2000 election would put blacks in key  committee chairmanships

The country needs ``more political maturity,'' not attempts to   eliminate affirmative action programs, Gore told about 500 people  at a dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus

``We don't need more division in America,'' Gore said, adding   that that his vision of the nation in the new millennium is that of  a place ``committed to justice as well as prosperity
''
Gore already has formed committees for seeking the Democratic   presidential nomination next year and named several key campaign  officials

Since the start of President Clinton's administration more   blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal  judges than ever before, he said

Despite the achievements, too many are still without adequate   health care or are forced to learn in crumbling, overcrowded  schools buildings, he said
 Blacks also remain twice as likely to  die at birth or from HIV/AIDS, or to be unemployed, he said

 (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of   political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured  the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and  party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire  and Iowa

With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire   crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop  in his onetime rival's hometown of St
 Louis

``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United   States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the  presidential race Feb
 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker  of the House

Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to   settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on  winning both the House and White House in November 2000
 President  Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his  understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents

Former New Jersey Sen
 Bill Bradley is the only announced   challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil  rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray
 ``I always expect it
