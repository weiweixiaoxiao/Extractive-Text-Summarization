LONDON (AP) -- Glaxo Wellcome PLC today released new data   indicating its drug Zeffix may help prevent chronic hepatitis B  sufferers from developing cirrhosis

The data from three large clinical studies showed a smaller   proportion of chronic hepatitis B patients treated with Zeffix  progressed to cirrhosis, or liver scarring, compared with those  treated with placebo or interferon-alpha

The results were presented at the annual meeting of the European   Association for the Study of the Liver in Naples, and supported by  other data showing additional Zeffix benefits, Glaxo said

Only 1
8 percent of Zeffix-treated patients progressed to   cirrhosis, compared with 7
1 percent placebo-treated patients and  9
5 percent of those treated with interferon-alpha

Glaxo said the results showed a continued increase in the   incidence of e-antigen seroconversion -- an immune response to the  virus that is thought to predict long-lasting remission of the  disease -- and a continued reduction in levels of viral replication

Zeffix is available in the Philippines, Canada and the U
 and   approved in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan and New Zealand
  Regulatory applications have been made in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and  Europe

Hepatitis B is a potentially fatal liver disease -- the   ninth-most common killer worldwide
 About 350 million people are  long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus and nearly one-third  are expected to develop progressive inflammation of the liver,  leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer

Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to   interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side  effects
PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A pharmacy that has had to turn away hepatitis   C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only treatment  available has started selling the drugs itself at half the price

Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in   Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month
  Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N
-based  Schering-Plough Corp

``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and   still not be able to afford the drug
'' said Don Kerrish, one of  the three druggists who own the pharmacy

Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3
9   million people in the United States
 It can lead to chronic liver  problems, including cirrhosis and cancer
 There is no vaccine  against it

For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell   their drugs
