ASHEVILLE, N
 (AP) -- Authorities did not discount a possible   connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial  bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing  Rudolph on Sunday

The clinic is about 75 miles east of the mountainous area where   Rudolph is believed to be hiding
 A news conference is scheduled  for Monday morning at the U
 attorney's office in Asheville

When asked Saturday about a possible link between the explosion   and Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage,  we don't discount anything
''
On Sunday, several FBI agents worked the scene outside the   one-story brick building that houses the Femcare Clinic, where the  bomb exploded early Saturday morning

Nobody was injured and there was little damage because the   device only partially detonated

``The investigation is still going on,'' said Asheville Police   Sgt
 Randy Riddle, who escorted news crews closer to the bombing  scene Sunday

Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that   received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium  anthrax
 Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics

Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the   run since the Jan
 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala
,  abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely  wounded a nurse

Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three   Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that  killed one person
ASHEVILLE, N
 (AP) -- Federal investigators said Monday that   they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric  Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but  they aren't ruling him out, either

The bomb partially detonated on Saturday morning outside the   Femcare Clinic in Asheville, about 75 miles west of the mountains  where agents have been searching for Rudolph for more than a year

No one was hurt in the blast, which caused little damage other   than leaving black marks on the outside of the one-story brick  building

``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work   of Eric Rudolph,'' U
 Attorney Mark Calloway said
 ``It is too  early, of course, to draw any conclusions

Richard Fox, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and   Firearms, said the powerful bomb could have ``devastated the entire  end of the building and gone into the building approximately 40 to  60 feet
