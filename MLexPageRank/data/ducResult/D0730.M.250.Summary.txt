WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation

In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress
 The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes

In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law
 Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills

Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending

But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures
''
Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government

Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional

A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised

Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws
 One was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the law, claiming it was injured by the veto

The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers' cooperatives

In February, a U
 District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president

On Thursday, the high court agreed

In his argument for the Clinton administration, U

Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H
