COLUMBIA, Md
 (AP) -- Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise   money for her legal fees
 Tripp, whose recordings of conversations with White House   intern Monica Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, is  sending about 20,000 fund-raising letters ``urgently'' asking for  contributions to her defense fund, The Washington Post reported  Friday

Her legal bills are already more than $325,000 and ``growing   every day,'' Mrs
 Tripp said in the 12-page letter

She describes herself as ``David up against Goliath'' in fending   off the attacks of Clinton's ``disciples'' and ``henchmen
''
Mrs
 Tripp, who lives in Columbia, is being investigated by a   Maryland grand jury for taping her phone conversations with Ms
  Lewinsky
 Maryland law forbids taping another person without their  knowledge and consent
 Tripp earns $90,767 a year in her Pentagon public affairs   job, according to The Post
Excerpts of deposition testimony by Monica Lewinsky and Vernon   Jordan, introduced by House prosecutors Thursday:
Q: ``
 your meeting with Vernon Jordan on Dec
 31, 1997
 Was   that to go back and talk about the job again
''
Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but 
 for me, the point of that   meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't  returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way  
 cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp  testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never  disclosed that to the president
 So that was sort of my intention  in meeting with Mr
 Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little  information and that would get passed on
''
Q: ``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt   Hotel
''
Lewinsky: ``Yes
''
Q: ``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and   your job search
''
Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing   New Year's Eve
''
Q: ``Specifically about some notes that you had at your   apartment
''
Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes
 That was really in relation to discussing   Linda Tripp
''

Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I   was acting on behalf of the President to get Ms
 Lewinsky a job

``I think, congressman, if in fact the president of the United   States' secretary calls and asks for a request, that you try to do  the best you can to make it happen

``I interpreted it as a request from the president

``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he   asked others to help
 I knew where I would need to call
''
Jordan: ``Yes
