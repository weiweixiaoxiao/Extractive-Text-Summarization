NEW YORK (AP) -- Beth Israel Medical Center, a large New York teaching hospital, this month opened a funky looking facility -- complete with pastel-colored walls and a waiting room with fluffy couches and a redwood bench -- where physicians work along side chiropractors and practitioners who specialize in homeopathy and clinical imagery

At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the most prestigious hospitals in Los Angeles, cardiac patients are given the option of receiving acupuncture or massage therapy after coronary bypass surgery

At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, known for its ground-breaking organ transplants, psychiatrists prescribe herbal medicines to help patients overcome depression

Hospitals, the bastions of Western medicine and high-tech gadgetry, are increasingly using procedures such as aromatherapy and Tai Chi to try to attract patients by tapping into one of the hottest trends in health care

Though the medical profession remains skeptical about the effectiveness of alternative therapies, hospital administrators say they can no longer escape the reality that millions of Americans routinely use them to complement -- or even take the place of -- traditional medicine

About 83 million Americans are spending some $27 billion a year on alternative care, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

With these patients and dollars in mind, about 13 percent of U
 hospitals provide alternative therapies, according to a survey of about 1,000 hospitals by the consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche
 The figure rises to 25 percent for inner city hospitals and 32 percent for hospitals with at least 500 beds

A decade ago, it would have been almost unheard of for hospitals to offer such services, industry analysts say
 That's changing fast

''It would be silly for doctors and hospitals to ignore something that will be a large part of health care for years to come,'' said Dr
 Matthew Fink, a neurologist who is president and chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center

But doctors and the practitioners of alternative care don't always mix well

Many doctors still are suspicious of alternative therapies and consider chiropractors and acupuncturists to be quacks
 And health insurers are reluctant to pay for most alternative procedures

Despite occasional setbacks, alternative care providers and medical practitioners are increasingly seeking to find common ground to help their businesses prosper
