LONDON (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime   television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready  to bail out of her long-running show

``I am all talked out,'' Winfrey told The Sunday Times
 ``My   contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows  because I feel they are going to burn themselves out
''
Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah   Winfrey Show'' in September 1986
 Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it  recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer  Show
''
While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told   the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her  stint on the movie set

``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more   dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said

Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling   his show a ``vulgarity circus
''
``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just   hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have  sexual intercourse -- and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy  pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes  a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted  as telling the Times

Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping   her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a  publicist in Chicago

Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued   Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey  would continue the show after the end of her current contract
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime   achievement award, Oprah Winfrey is taking herself out of the  running for best talk show host at this year's ceremony

``Last year I was given the lifetime achievement award,'' she   said in an interview scheduled to air Tuesday on ``The Roseanne  Show
'' ``And after you've achieved it for a lifetime, what else is  there
''
The Daytime Emmys will be held May 21
