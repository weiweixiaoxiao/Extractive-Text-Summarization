TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Phoenician mariners sailed more than   2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean,  praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet  death in a fierce tempest

Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two   ships -- the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the  same techniques he used to find the Titanic

The vessels' cargo -- large ceramic containers of wine -- was   probably headed to the Pharaoh's table in Egypt or to the  Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia, Ballard told  a news conference Wednesday, in announcing the discovery

The ships' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician   port of Tyre -- now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B
 Both vessels  were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled  with wine

Remarkably, the amphorae were found intact, stacked snugly in   rows, unlike the shards typically unearthed on land
 Archaeologist  Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on  Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one  of our greatest moments
''
The ships were also almost perfectly preserved -- a result of the   bitter cold deep-sea waters, where sunlight cannot reach, the  pressure is intense and sediment scarcely accumulates

Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of   suspending history in time
 ``Human history lost in the high seas  is waiting to be discovered,'' said Ballard, who was propelled to  fame by his 1985 discovery of the ocean liner Titanic

Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the   Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an  underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global  positioning satellite
 He was led to the area after a team looking  for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago,  photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient  shipwreck

The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor   at a depth of about 1,500 feet
 The fact that they sank straight to  the bottom and were located within two miles of each other  indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said

Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not   previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to  find more ancient wrecks along the same path

One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45   feet
 and 1200 B
 A report is due in four months
