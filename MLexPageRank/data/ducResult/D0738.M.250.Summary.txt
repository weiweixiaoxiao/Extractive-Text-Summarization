GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Refugees from Guatemala's civil war   returned to their homeland from Mexico on Thursday, marking the  final chapter of an international effort to resettle them

United Nations officials called the return of 294 Guatemalans a   successful example of resettlement efforts
 With Thursday's return,  a total of 41,633 Guatemalans have been helped home

About 13,000 Guatemalan refugees remain in 60 camps in the   southern Mexican state Chiapas
 They will either return  individually or stay in Mexico under a nationalization program  offered by that country

The refugees were welcomed with religious services and music   Thursday in the town square of Coatepeque, 125 miles west of  Guatemala
 They are the last group to be resettled under a  U
-supervised program in which the Guatemalan government offered  them low-interest loans to buy farmland

Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fled to Mexico and the United   States beginning in 1981 amid violence from the country's civil  war

QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Striking bus drivers blocked streets and   many businesses closed their doors Thursday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's  largest city, in a one-day strike against the government's economic  reforms

About half of the businesses in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest   of Quito, closed to protest President Jamil Mahuad's proposal to  raise taxes to reduce the small South American nation's $1
2  billion budget deficit
 Bus drivers blocked roads with their  vehicles to protest the planned gasoline price increase

Municipal workers demanding a greater share of the nation's   budget for cities also joined the strike, placing city trucks and  construction equipment across roads to strengthen the blockades

The protest was largely peaceful
 Guayaquil police reported   arresting 25 striking drivers for causing disturbances

In eight months in office, Mahuad has faced two national strikes   and repeated street protests as he tries to reform Ecuador's  bankrupt economy and drag it from its worst economic crisis in  decades
