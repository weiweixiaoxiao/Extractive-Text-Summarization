NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed   by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his  identity for the character of George Costanza

State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael   Costanza's suit was frivolous

Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his   rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and  persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld
''
Costanza said the show portrayed him in a negative, humiliating   light, and that ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David defamed him  when he called Costanza a ``liar'' and ``flagrant opportunist''  trying to cash in

Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed   sanctions of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer,  Jonathan Fisher
