WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif
 (AP) -- Potential bidders expressed qualms   about buying O
 Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the  collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction

``I find the whole thing a little bit sad, to take away the   Heisman Trophy,'' said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles, who came to  view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on  Friday
 ``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him
''
Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college   football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned
 The catalog  noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as  ``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque

Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the   Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy

``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said   Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the  Butterfield and Butterfield auction house

The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home   at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain  ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman
 They  won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the  murders in criminal court

Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred   Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he  would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom
''
He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to   help satisfy the $33
5 million civil court judgment against him

``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown   pockets,'' Beardsley said
 ``I believe he's not responsible for  this crime, and I think there are a lot of people who believe  that
''
Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery   were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson  during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No
  32 football jerseys; oriental carpets; paintings and Tiffany-style  lamps

The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned   by Simpson's first wife, Marguerite
Some of the items sold at an auction of O
